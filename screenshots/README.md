- Clear browser cache and use incognito mode for clean screenshots
- Use sample data that looks professional
- Capture both desktop and mobile views
- Highlight key features with annotations if needed
- Use tools like:
  - Windows: Snipping Tool or Win + Shift + S
  - Mac: Cmd + Shift + 4
  - Browser extensions: Awesome Screenshot, Fireshot

## Image Optimization

Before committing, optimize images:
- Use PNG for UI screenshots
- Compress images (TinyPNG, ImageOptim)
- Keep file sizes under 500KB each
- Consider using WebP format for better compression
